## 1 Redshift Analysis of Starburst Galaxy M82

Some of the main indications that dark matter exists in our universe are galaxy rotation curves, graphs of the orbital speeds of matter spinning around a galaxy as a function of distance from the center.

In this project, I analyze data from galaxy Messier 82, using information about redshift to approximate the galaxy rotation curve. 

Capstone project for Physics 100: Observational Astrophysics.

## 2 Roman Concrete Stressor Analysis

How does Roman concrete react to stressors common to the Italian coast? 

Final project for the Bing Overseas Seminar: Pozzuoli. 

## 3 Vortices in Superconducting Niobium

In type-II superconductors, applied external magnetic fields trigger the formation of magnetic field vortices.

This paper explores and analyzes the behavior of these vortices in a niobium superconductor. 

Part of my final project for Physics 108: Advanced Physics Laboratory.
